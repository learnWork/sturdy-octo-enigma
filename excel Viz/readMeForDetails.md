Imagine a scenario, you have been working day and night on different screens. However the setup is so professionally setup that there is a record of all the changes in made and need to be done in form of "Bugs".
Definately the files won't be clean. Cleaning and categorizing the data became 1st step to visualization.
Newly created fields like : 

  1.Screens - Using excel tools like Vlookup & Advanced Filters based on description & title categorise bugs into single UI-screen section or common for all screens.
  2.StatusCombined - Creating binary categories like open/closed.
  
Hence the fields used for creating the graph will be expalined as below:

  #Bugs - number of bugs (including both requirements and changes).
  Screen - the different application screens + the common parts such as header, navigator, UI(fonts, color, etc), browser issue and so on that the project has. 
  
Finally just creating graphs and table makes you feel something is still missing. Hence give finishing touches 
  1. by coloring the common categories like in "reactJSDummyViz2-part1.png"
  2. Adding extra details like grand totals as secondary axis like in "reactJSDummyViz3-part1.png"
  3. Finally adding details like appropriate axis names, formating the tables and adding text formatting.
